## Overview

This Snake game is designed to be self-contained in one HTML file. When run in a modern browser, it displays a 600x600 pixel playground where you can control a snake that eats food to grow longer.

- **Simple, Intuitive Controls**: Uses the WASD keys for movement.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends if you hit the walls or run into your own body.
